Digital Forensics Platform based in Ethereum Blockchain
Welcome to the repository for my Bachelor's Thesis on the design of a Blockchain platform using Edge Computing infrastructure for the storage of Digital Evidence. This project aims to explore the potential of combining Blockchain technology with Edge Computing to create a robust and secure system for storing digital evidence in a decentralized manner.

In this repository the following can be found:
Smart Contract written in Solidity to store and retrieve data (certificates and evidences) into the Blockchain
Scripts written in Python to interact with the provided Smart Contract and to retrieve data from a Raspberry Pi through SSH.
